about: My name is Nico, I live in germany and love tech stuff, music and photography. Luckily, I can leverage my affinity for hardware and software in my job as IT consultant. On the arty side of live I played electric guitar in a band many years ago. Hopefully, there will be another chance to do so in future :)
